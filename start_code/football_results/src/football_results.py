# For a final score in a football game we'd like to 
# get a description of the result -
# - "Home win"
# - "Away win"
# - "Draw"

# A final score has this dictionary structure -

# ```python
# {    
#     "home_score": 0,
#     "away_score": 1
# }
# ```
# We'd also like to get a list of results for a 
# list of final scores.

# ```python
#     ["Home win", ...]
# ```
